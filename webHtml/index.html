           <p>The Trump administration is halting all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Joseph Edlow has said.

On Friday, in a post on X, Edlow said the pause would be in place "until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible".

The announcement comes hours after President Donald Trump pledged to "permanently pause migration" to the US from all "third world countries".

On Thursday, Trump announced that a US National Guard member had died from her injuries after Wednesday's shooting, for which an Afghan national has been blamed.</p>

          <h2>Zelensky's top adviser resigns after anti-corruption raid on his home</h2>

           <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.

Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: "We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future."</p>

          <h2>Hungary's Orban defies EU partners and meets Putin again in Moscow</h2>
          <p><i>Nick Thorpe,Budapest correspondentandPatrick Jackson</i></p>

           <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, days before Russia holds talks on a US push to end the war in Ukraine.

Orban is seen as one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and he has consistently angered his Nato and EU allies by undermining solidarity against Russia.

"We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine," Putin told Orban in remarks carried by Russian state TV.

Posting later on social media, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the Hungarians had got what they came to Moscow for: guaranteed supplies of Russian oil and gas, and agreement to continue the construction of the Paks nuclear power station.</p>
